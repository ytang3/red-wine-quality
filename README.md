# red-wine-quality

This Red Wine Quality dataset contained 1,599 observations of red wines. There’re
12 variables in the dataset, including 11 variables of chemical properties in
these wines, and 1 output variable of wine quality, which graded by experts and
is between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

I’m interested in exploring how these chemical properties influence the quality
of wine. Through univariate, bivariate, multivariate analysis and statistical
analysis, I tested different relationships between these variables.
